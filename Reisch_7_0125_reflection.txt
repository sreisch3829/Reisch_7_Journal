I was able to make a working game where you can lose and win, but I was
unable to make the enemies able to move or deal damage. My map, sprite, and
walls were able to work (relatively) well.

It was definately not the best game by any means, but it at least works to 
and extent. I was able to solve some of my problems, after some assistance
was given to me, I was able to get some things working.
