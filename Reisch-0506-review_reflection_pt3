Which is the x coordinate? The x coordinate is 42.

Which is the y coordinate? The y coordinate is 66.

Why? The way the computer programs makes it less than one.

How does this happen? The y is registered first and then the x.

#a- The computer will print 8888.

#b- It prints the map while the map is less than j and i is equal to zero.

#c- It prints a . except if there's an x. If j is more than the map length, then
don't print 8888.

#d- It prints the map while the map is more than j and i is not specified.

You can use a while loop to stop the boolean under a certain specific condition(s).

Static allows for a part of the code to be the same throughout the code.

You could use an object to be able to express a certain values that you can't 
otherwise- i.e. win and lose screens.
