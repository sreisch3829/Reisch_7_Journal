This would set up the animations for a sprite across any x, 8 location (aka if you go up).

It would be unrealistic to memorize Slick syntax because it will become negligible soon. We are learning
to practice how to solve problems.

An array is a list of values.
Ex. 
String [] berries = ["cherry, strawberry, blueberry"];

An ArrayList is to hold one value (or multipule specific values) to one item replicated.

Three useful arraylist methods I have identified are Sort(), Reverse(), and Clone().

The difference between an array and an arraylist is that an array cannot be changed but an arraylist can
be changed. Array holds different sets of numbers or values while an arraylist holds the same value 
across multipule objects made.

We could make a health counter for an avatar would be by using a counter, method, and an arraylist.
