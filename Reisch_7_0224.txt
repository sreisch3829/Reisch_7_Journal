A class is a different section of code that runs like a program of its own.

public class Rat {
public Rat brown, gray, black, white, tawny;

brown = new Rat(42, 42);
gray = new Rat (5, 5);
black = new Rat (10, 10);
white = new Rat (7, 30);
tawny = new Rat (60, 20);

}

Declaration is placed in the overall program (if you're using it outside of the class,
anyways).

Initialization is placed in the init class.

int Rats = new int ["42, 42", "5, 5", "10, 10", "7, 30", "60, 20"]
