1. I will use methods in my game to be able to control and be able to tell what the player has done. This will 
help me dertermine if the player had finished the puzzle or not. This will help determine if the player loses
or not-- a vital part in my game. Another part it would be used is determining where the player wants to go
and being able to manipulate it better.
