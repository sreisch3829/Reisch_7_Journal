I am moderately ready, but I will need to look over my notes at least once or twice.

I only will have questions with what the coding problems I may have.

I have to get most of the things to work, excepting enemies and taking damage, but I have to 
tweak everything.

I am not prepared, but I do have some ways to help myself with some problems that I may 
encounter. My biggest problem would likely be the inventory and traps. I am expecting myself 
to run into problems, but I will likely seek help afterschool from Mr. Davis.
