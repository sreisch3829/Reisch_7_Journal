I have noticed that it is similar with various coding like loops and if 
statements. It is different as it works with physical objects as opposed to just code. It
is a bit straightforward, with what you have to assign but the hard part is 
making the objects work fully.

I have made so far adaptations to include more of an input from the player.

A circuit must have a power source to a computer and code in order to run properly.

Programs are compiled with Arduino by sending the code in a little package.

The projects we have completed include working to circuit 14. We have made
LED lights light up, both with buttons and with a potentiometer. We have made 
sounds activate and play music. We have also made a temperature sensor work.

The project I would make is a true/false questionare and the code adaptions 
we would make is the differences in having certain lights light up with one
sound.
