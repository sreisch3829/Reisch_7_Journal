We make a class by declaring it:
public static Class {
}

This is not a class constructor.

We make classes with values by creating values we need like coordinates, size, or speed. 
We make a class constructor by setting these values and using them.

A getter is a small program that retrieves values code from a class.
A setter is a small program that sets values within a class.

In an array of breakfast we would have eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, toast. You
You would create one by doing
String breakfast [] = "Eggs", "Bacon", "Pancakes", "Waffles", "Toast";
Breakfast [] FamilyBreakfast;
Breakfast Joseph = new Breakfast(4, 8, 2, true);
Breakfast Sarah = new Breakfast(2, 0, 0, true);
Breakfast Dad = new Breakfast(4, 8, 9, false);
Breakfast Mom = new Breakfast(3, 0, 0, false);
FamilyBreakfast = {Joseph, Sarah, Dad, Mom};


Donut chocolatefilled = new Donut(true, false, 100);
chocolatefilled.setTemperature(72);
chocolatefilled.getIsGlazed();
