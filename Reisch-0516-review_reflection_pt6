Casting is where you change one datatype to another. Up-casting is making the
datatype bigger. Down-casting is making the datatype smaller.

Up-casting:
int j = 3;
double twin;
twin = j;

Down-casting:
double twin = 3.0;
int j;
twin = (int)j;

Converting char to a String:
char c = 'c';
String sally;
sally = "" + c;

The range of values for byte is 
char = -128 to 127
int = -32,768 to 32,768
short = -32,768 to 32,768
long = -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648.
