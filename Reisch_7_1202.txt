I was successful because I used examples throughout my essay to express which part of the rubric I completed. I
also put the map of the game along with the code itself within the essay at the end in order for you to be able 
to look at it within one document. Another reason I was successful was because I explained each part of the rubric
I did in short, easy to read paragraphs with a noticable difference when I gave examples of code.
