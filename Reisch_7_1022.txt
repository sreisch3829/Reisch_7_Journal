The purpose of the code art that I am creating is to show my skill in coding and what the limits of my skills are with the knowledge I have. 
Code art will be the first step to more complex things that we will envitably start to code.

The purpose of creating art with code to learn is so that we can tweak it with the colors to get something more asthethically pleasing and have a clear idea for what we want.
It gives us a way to visually see what we are doing without it being overly complex- to see the littlest of differences with ease.
