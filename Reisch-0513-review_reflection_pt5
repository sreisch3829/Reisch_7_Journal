I remembered some things from the arrays, mosty from the journal and 
from some talks about arrays, but this was far more in-depth. Reflecting
on the assignment, it primarily focuses on arrays, while most other times
I was focusing on other things.

1. What is an array?
2. What is a class?
3. What does OOP stand for?
4. How do you use a while loop?
5. What is a class constructor?
6. How do you initialize an object?
7. How do you create 
8. How do you use assembly?
9. What is low-level programming?
10. What is higher level learning?
