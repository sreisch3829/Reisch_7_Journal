I think I was pretty sucessful with my game, accomplishing most of the things 
within the rubric while also providing a challenge.

I did so by using methods and classes to be able to "remember" certain elements
and implement them later in the game when it was necessary. I did what I was 
comfortable with but also took some risks in tinkering with the code.
