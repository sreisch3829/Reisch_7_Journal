1. A method is a boolean that has a little program inside of it.

2. I used one to encompass whether the game would play or not, and used another to attempt to close 
the game, which didn't work as well.

3. A while loop is a way to have something repeat until it is false or complete.

4. I used a while loop to have a way to stop the program, a boolean to keep everything neat and tidy,
and the counter is used to tell the user how many tries it took.
