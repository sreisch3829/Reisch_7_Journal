Steve Ballmer called GPL a virus because he saw it as having no real purpose to the real life applications.

The difference between open source and proprietary software is that open source is available to use for everyone while proprietary had more terms and conditions. 

The differences between GPL and MIT license is MIT is more about reusing software while GPL is more about editing and running programs on said software.
