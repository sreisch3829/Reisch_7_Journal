1. private void cubed () {
	int x = x;
	int y = y;
	x * x * x = y;
	return y;
	}
2. void loop () {
	pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
	}
3. public class student {
	int grade; 
	String name;
	}
4. I would create the lights to represent numbers so that entering a number, 
you could recieve the triple of the light. (Aka, pressing light 3 would 
activate light 9).
