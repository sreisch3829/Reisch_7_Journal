Yesterday we completed the repository for github and made sure that all of the files would be on the directory. Everyday, we will have to get into the directory and make a pico journal. 
This will make it so that all of our files are in one place rather than hundreds of places. We have to remember to date them correctly or else we could cry (but that's besides the point).
One thing I must remember is to properly name things rather than make many mistakes.
