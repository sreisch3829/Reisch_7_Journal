Proceeding in an organized manner is important because you need a map for what you want to do. If you get lost, you can always refer back to the map. Planning what you want to do is 
a very good skill to learn because you want to have a good idea for what's ahead and what's in the past. You can always change a plan but if your just making it up as you go along, 
you can really change what's coming next.
