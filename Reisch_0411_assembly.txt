An assembly is a way to program, like Java, C++, but more complicated. 

An assembly is good for keeping coding simple and complete control over system
hardware.

Assembly is different than Java because it is a low level language and harder
to understand and pick up than Java.

The differences between high level and low level languages is that high level 
is portable, less lines of code, and mantainance is easier.

Java is high level, because it is portable, less difficult than learning Assembly
and is less error prone.

Assembly is low level, because it is not portable, more difficult than learning
Java, and is more error prone.
