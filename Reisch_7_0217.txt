Arrays are used for listing data and holding values to ask for it later.
The code for an int array:
int[] = "1, 2, 3";
The code for a String array:
String[] = ("Hello World!");
The code for a boolean array:
boolean[] = "t, s, y";
The code for a double array:
double[] = "5.5, 4.4, 3.3";
You would change the first value of the int array to 42 by changing the number
itself in the code.
You would change the string to "Bob" in the string array by changing the words
in the code itself.
The code prints three lines that say dessert.
It would print "rice pudding", "pan dulce", and "bunelos" but it's different
because they are sequencial in the lines printed out.
We would replace "bunuelos" with "apple pie" by changing the code itself.
