My guessing game is almost a game! It has most of the components but it is not quite finished but it is a game in the sense that the player can interact
and do different things with the enviroment.

To make the game better, it would have to be more interactive with different actions and more of a story perhaps or more of a puzzle element. 
Right now it's just a game of chance, that can easily change.
