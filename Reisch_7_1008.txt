My plans for the art project is to have multiple shapes with different colors for each- creating a rainbow.

The methods I will use are to control the color, different shapes, and amount. 

I might incorperate a for loop by having it to have several random colors for each shape.

I might incorperate an if, else if, else statement by creating each new shape so there is an equal amount. 

The math I might use is geometry, in order to make sure that all my shapes will do as I manipulate them.
