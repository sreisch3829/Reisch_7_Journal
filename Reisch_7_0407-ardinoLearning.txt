1. I have learned so far that CS is difficult when you smash code together. It's 
hard to tell where you have to place all of the code, but with the internet it's 
not that bad. It confuses me, but more experience will assist.

2. I have also learned that CS is difficult because it's not the same as netbeans. 
Where with netbeans I would be able to look back at old projects for any help, 
this one is only with examples, which is better overall. It doesn't have the 
same comfort, but it provides completely accurate code, as opposed to my bugy code. 

3. I have finally learned that CS is difficult because it is a different program
entirely with it having some different words. As they have different words, it
is a little hard to see what terns are the same. But as we sift though the
code, it's getting easier.
