I created a game that is in space, where you have to get past some enemies in each section in order to 
get to the objective- a spaceship.

I solved some problems with getting the game and map to work- and I have attempted to work the ai for
the the enemies, but I have some trouble currently.

I was able to create the spritesheet pretty quickly- in two minutes or so, and the map I was tinkering 
around with in order to get it working the way I wanted it to. I finished the spiritesheet before and 
the map after the winter break from some issues I was facing.

I was not able to meet the timeline, just due to how much I was stuck with certain elements of the game, 
but the game is testable.
