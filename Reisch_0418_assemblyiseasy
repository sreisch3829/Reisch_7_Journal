We typed elf64 to execute the program in correlation with 64 bits. 
We used ld to compile the code in turn.
We did not have to use chmod to make sample executable because it was already
programmed within the code to occur.

I had to change certain numeric values along with what I wanted to say.
It is not quick and easy, it is long but you know everything your doing.
Low level means that it is a more basic and layed out version to see all of your
coding that you have out/
