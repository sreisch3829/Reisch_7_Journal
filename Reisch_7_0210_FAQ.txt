1. My first problem was getting the orb made, but thankfully making it with
Mr. Davis made me comprehend what was going on.
2. My second problem was getting the orb to do damage to the skeletons, which 
I may have solved.
for (Enemy e : bonez) {
                    if (magic8ball.hitbox.intersects(e.rect)) {
                        e.isvisible = false;
                    }
                }
3. My third problem was making the orb be blocked where the tiles are, but
I'm not sure how to solve that problem yet. I assume that I have to change 
things in blocked.
4. My fourth problem is getting the orb to fire smoothly, though I have 
set it up.
