They both have conditional jumps, (if negative, if zero). The difference is
that in assembly is that you can assign what the jump is, while HRM already
has it assigned for you.

The differences is that assembly can compare specific values to another 
specific value while HRM aviods that to make its puzzles more difficult for
the player.
