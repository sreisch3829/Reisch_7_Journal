We have sucessfully gotten all the code necesssary for the questionaire, and 
finished the placement for all the equipment we need.

We still need to finish the coding itself for the equipment to work properly 
without an example code.

We might be able to turn in a questionaire that lights up if you get a wrong or
right answer for which button you press. Getting the buzzer to work may be on 
Tuesday or so.

We are changing code for a light and a buzzer to work togeter when a button 
is pushed. 

We have noted how to compile elements from the examples so far.
