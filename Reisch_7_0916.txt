The three guiding rules for this class:
-Tinker
-Helping others helps you
-No cellphones

We have these guidlines in order to help ourselves when we encounter a problem in coding. When we show these in practice, we learn what we need to do (and what not to do). 

The problem solving process is to (1) define the problem, (2) generate solutions, (3) decide the course of action, (4) implement the solution, and finally (5) evalute the solution.

The underlying motivation for this process is to solve any and all problems in life in general (but for this class, mostly for coding).

It relates to Perkins et al because of the Stoppers just give up while the Movers tinker and move on and suceed.
