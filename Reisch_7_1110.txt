1. In my game, I can track what challenges the player has solved by making the while loop based 
on the challenges that the player will face, therefore it can be called true when they complete it.
2. I can track HP with a counter and an if statement, by using the if statement to tell when/why 
they lose/gain HP and a counter to keep track and show what it is currently.
3. For items, I'm not as sure for what I'll do, but maybe it will be a set inventory that's the same 
until changed by the user? I'm not quite sure yet.
